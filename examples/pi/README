In the different directories, there are several configuration files with
the extension ".pm". To execute the examples, these files must be
modified to include the machines where the user has remote access.

An example of configuration file is presented in the following lines:

my %debug = (host1 => 0, host2 => 0, host3 => 0, host4 => 0);       # Debug mode for each machine: 0 | 1
my %max_num_np = (host1 => 2, host2 => 1, host3 => 3, host4 => 1);  # Maximum number of processes for each machine

return (debug => \%debug, max_num_np => \%max_num_np);
